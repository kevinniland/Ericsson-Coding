// Forgot to upload this, and just factory reset my laptop so I don't have it any more but the question was:

// Given an array, return a 1, 0, or -1 depending on the product of that array
// [3, 4, 6] = The product of this array is positive so return 1
// [-3, 2, 1] = The product of this array is negative so return -1
// Can't quite remember the 0 but I think if the product is 0, return 0
